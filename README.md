The Recipe project is a simple webpage which reinforces what I have learned in the HTML and CSS foundations. In this project, I have demonstrated how to do the following:

    •   utilize basic structure of HTML;
    •   use text-based elements (e.g., headings, paragraphs);
    •   use lists (e.g., unordered, ordered);
    •   insert image;
    •   link to relative pages;
    •   link external CSS to HTML;
    •   use common properties in CSS;
    •   utilize different kinds of selectors;
